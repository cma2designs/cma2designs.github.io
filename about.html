        <h3>Design Interests & Inspiration</h3>
        <p>My interests in design are broad. I feel like understanding design in different mediums can help elevate your design in every medium. My main interests are in web design and graphic design. I also enjoy drawing in graphite and continue to explore other media as well. As I view my own work and the work of others, the small details of design are some of the most interesting to me. I have a background in biology, and find that nature is very inspirational in the designs I create in ways both subtle and overt.</p>
        <h3>Designing as a Service</h3>
        <p>My personal, school, and work history make me uniquely qualified in the field of design. I have always been a highly detail oriented person, and have been described by others as deliberate in the things that I do. I am keenly open to new ideas and changing my mind, and have a philosophy in life that there is always more we can learn. My career did not start in design, but my life has certainly lead me to this point. I have a breadth of experience in biology, research, education, customer service, and project management, which all help to inform who I am as a designer. I have experience with the Adobe Creative Suite, HTML, CSS, typography, as well as the principles of design that give me the necessary skills to create funtional and inventive designs.</p>
        <h3>Other Hobbies & Interests</h3>
        <p>Besides design, I am a lover of puzzles and games. Rock climbing has been a favorite hobby of mine for these reasons. A lot of rock climbing is problem solving the best way to get to the top of the wall. I really enjoy the process of puzzling this out, especially with my friends, and other climbers. I always have great time playing board games and card games with friends, and video games (especially open world games). When it comes time to wind down and relax I enjoy cooking, listening to music, and taking my sweet dog Clover for a walk to the park and coffee shop.</p>
