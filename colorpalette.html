            <h3>Color Palette</h3>
            <p>When planning my website I changed my initial color palette after spending some time working near my favorite succulent, which is also now a part of the website logo. I noticed how much of a variety of complimentary and interesting colors were present in this one tiny plant, and set about creating an accessible color palette to add to my website.</p>
