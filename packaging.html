            <h3>Coffee Packaging Design</h3>
            <p>This packaging design was created for my typography course. The subject is a fictional coffee roasting company. I used to work as a Barista and always really loved coffees that had fruit forward flavors, so I created a company that was focused on these flavors.</p>
